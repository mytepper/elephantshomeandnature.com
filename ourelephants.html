                            <p>Duk Dik is a young female of 12 years old. Born in 2004 in Surin province, 
                            she came to Elephant Home and Nature at the beginning of December 2016.She 
                            was previously staying in an elephant camp in Hua Hin where she was chained all 
                            the time and due to the policy of the place the mahouts had to carry a hook and hit 
                            her whenever she wasn’t immediately responding to a command. Also she had to 
                            perform shows for tourists and didn’t have the chance to bath and play in a river. 
                            After a first hesitant approach to the water, now she lovesevery single minute she 
                            spend in the river Kwai and in a much more relaxed environment she can finally 
                            show her truly sweet and friendly personality.Like every teenager she’s always in 
                            search of attentions, especially from her good friends Orm that she constantly 
                            pokes with her curious trunk. She’s a bit jealous of Mongkol, our 9 months old baby, 
                            which is stealing all the attentions. You can see her disappointed when he gets fed 
                            the milk. She would love to have it as well!!She’s pretty easy to identify. Due to her 
                            young age she’s quite smaller than the other elephants and she still doesn’t have 
                            visible tusks. She doesn’t present any patch of depigmentation on the trunk, but she 
                            has two peculiar spots on her cheekbones. If you want her to love you give her 
                            bananas and sugarcanes, but don’t feed her sweet potatoes; even a small one and 
                            she will spit everything out!</p>

                            <h1 class="title-clr">Orm</h1>
                            <p>Orm is 22 years old female. Born in 1994 in Surin province, she came to Elephant 
                            Home and Nature at the beginning of December 2016.She was previously living 
                            with others of our elephants in a camp in Hua Hin where she was forced with a 
                            hook to perform tricks and shows for the tourists and she couldn’t enjoy a good 
                            swim in the river. At a younger age she has been travelling to Japan and China as 
                            a ‘’superstar’’ in highly unethical boxing competitions. Because of all these negative 
                            experiences she is quite wary with strangers. When she arrived here she presented 
                            an eye infection that has been successfully treated by our vet team.
                            Nevertheless she quickly adjusted to her new home and she loves her multiple 
                            daily bath with her younger friend Duk Dik. Like an old sister she carefully plays 
                            with her in the water and patiently accepts all her attentions.<br>
                            Compared to the other females she has a shorter but bigger trunk with a lot of 
                            patches of depigmentation. She presents a visible small left tusk and an even 
                            smaller right one. She loves any treats but her favorite ones are pineapples and 
                            pumpkins. If you start dancing and singing in front of her she will keep up with the 
                            rhythm!! And if you have a hula-hoop give it to her. She will surprise you!</p>

                            <h1 class="title-clr">Jumbo</h1>
                            <p>Jumbo is a 21 years old male born in Surin province in 1995. He’s the second 
                            elephant who came to Elephants’ Home and Nature in December 2016.
                            He was previously living in an Elephant Camp in Damnoen Saduak in Ratchaburi 
                            province where he was used for riding activities with a heavy basket chair and he 
                            had to perform circus-style shows for tourists.<br>
                            When he arrived at Elephants’ Home and Nature he presented a major abscess on 
                            the front right shoulder with the inflammation spreading down the whole leg. This 
                            prevents him from walking properly making impossible for him to bend the right 
                            knee. He also has problems with the front left ankle bending unnaturally outside of 
                            the normal loKation. The reason of this is a bad fall in the water drain that occurred 
                            to him when he was younger. The situation is constantly monitored by two vet 
                            teams from Mahidol University and Wildlife Hospital in Sayok and Kasetstart 
                            Veterinary University that come every few days to check Jumbo and give him the 
                            best possible treatment.  Any interaction with tourists will be avoided until full 
                            recovery.<br>
                            He’s easy to identify being the biggest elephant in our camp. He doesn’t present 
                            any task at all. It’s getting more and more common to observe Asian males 
                            elephants that were born without tusks (it’s estimated that at least 10% of the total 
                            do not have tusks). This is observed by several studies on African elephants too 
                            and it’s due to a natural evolution process. Tuskless elephants are more likely to 
                            survive not being killed by poachers.<br>
                            Jumbo has a fierce personality. He’s totally comfortable and attached to his mahout 
                            and people who he’s used to but it might be dangerous when approached by totally 
                            strangers. Nevertheless he’s quickly getting used to the home and he’s now a lot 
                            friendlier than he was at the beginning. When you greet him don’t be surprised if
                            you have a very vocal elephant ‘’Krub’’ in return!!

                            <p>Nuk is a 23 years old female born in Surin province in 1993. She came to Elephants’ 
                                Home and Nature in mid-December 2016.<br>
                                Before getting here she was living with Duk Dik and Orm in an elephant camp in 
                                Hua Hin where she was chained all the time and due to the policy of the place the 
                                mahouts had to carry a hook and hit her whenever she wasn’t immediately 
                                responding to a command. Also she had to perform shows for tourists and didn’t 
                                have the chance to bath and play in a river.
                                When she arrived here she was clearly underweight. After a couple of weeks of 
                                proper diet and adequate supplements she’s quickly gaining weight and going back 
                                to a healthier body shape. <br>
                                At Elephants’ Home and Nature she looks super relaxed and comfortable with the 
                                new environment and the new people. For this reason it was a big surprise for us to 
                                know that in the past years she managed to escape twice from the previous camps 
                                that were hosting her. In the second occasion it took three days to the mahouts and 
                                the authorities to find her. According to the mahout that is taking care of her, she’s 
                                the fastest runner he ever saw!! Thus she got her nickname: Turbo! She loves 
                                receiving hugs and kisses on her trunk! Another thing that she never experienced before.
                                She’s quite tall and definitely a bit skinnier than the other girls. She presents a patch 
                                of depigmentation on the mid-trunk but quite darker compared to other elephants. 
                                She has short tusks with only the left one slightly coming out of the mouth.

                            <p>Kat is a 22 years old female born in Surin province. She arrived at Elephants’ Home 
                            and Nature in December 2016 with her 8 months old baby Mongkol. 
                            Before getting here she was living in Hua Hin, but in a different camp from the one 
                            Duk Dik, Orm and Nuk come from. Anyway the treatment she received was the 
                            same: chain all day long and abuse of the hook to control her. She was used for 
                            riding activities with a heavy basket chair (at Elephants Home and Nature guests 
                            can ride only bareback. Any additional weight is useless and dangerous for the 
                            animal health). The results of these were several scars on her body and severe 
                            signs of stereotypical behavior like constantly swinging her trunk and her head. 
                            After a couple of weeks at our place she’s getting definitely better and she looks 
                            a lot more relaxed.
                            To identify her look for the female with the trunk almost totally covered with 
                            depigmentation marks. Her tusks are both visible and the right one is quite long 
                            compared to the other females.
                            Her favorite food are pineapple and coconut. She doesn’t like loud notice but 
                            biggest enemies are…dogs!! If a dog get close to her she will try to kick him 
                            immediately. The two dogs roaming around Elephants Home and Nature have 
                            already learnt that it’s better to stay away from her.</p>

                            <p>Mongkol is a 9 months old male calf born in March 2016 in Hua Hin. He arrived at 
                            Elephants’ Home and Nature in December 2016 together with his mum Kat.
                            He’s coming from an elephant camp in Hua Hin where his future would have 
                            probably been of chains, hooks and circus-style shows. Signs and marks on his 
                            body show that the training process was already started. At our place his life will be 
                            full of love, cuddles, treats and refreshing baths in the river Kwai. No needs to say 
                            that all the staff is already in love with him and the only risk that he’s facing is to be 
                            over spoiled.He shows already a strong and fierce personality chasing everything 
                            and everyone. His trunk is constantly active to smell, touch and grab everything he 
                            comes across in order to satisfy his natural curiosity.
                            His favorite food at the moment is sugar cane. He just discovered it and he’s crazy 
                            about it. Like his mother Kat he doesn’t like dogs at all and he clearly shows his 
                            displeasure if they’re standing too close to him.

                            <p>Duk Dik is a young female of 12 years old. Born in 2004 in Surin province, 
                            she came to Elephant Home and Nature at the beginning of December 2016.She 
                            was previously staying in an elephant camp in Hua Hin where she was chained all 
                            the time and due to the policy of the place the mahouts had to carry a hook and hit 
                            her whenever she wasn’t immediately responding to a command. Also she had to 
                            perform shows for tourists and didn’t have the chance to bath and play in a river. 
                            After a first hesitant approach to the water, now she lovesevery single minute she 
                            spend in the river Kwai and in a much more relaxed environment she can finally 
                            show her truly sweet and friendly personality.Like every teenager she’s always in 
                            search of attentions, especially from her good friends Orm that she constantly 
                            pokes with her curious trunk. She’s a bit jealous of Mongkol, our 9 months old baby, 
                            which is stealing all the attentions. You can see her disappointed when he gets fed 
                            the milk. She would love to have it as well!!She’s pretty easy to identify. Due to her 
                            young age she’s quite smaller than the other elephants and she still doesn’t have 
                            visible tusks. She doesn’t present any patch of depigmentation on the trunk, but she 
                            has two peculiar spots on her cheekbones. If you want her to love you give her 
                            bananas and sugarcanes, but don’t feed her sweet potatoes; even a small one and 
                            she will spit everything out!</p>

                            perform shows for tourists and didn’t have the chance to bath and play in a river. 
                            After a first hesitant approach to the water, now she lovesevery single minute she 
                            spend in the river Kwai and in a much more relaxed environment she can finally 
                            show her truly sweet and friendly personality.Like every teenager she’s always in 
                            search of attentions, especially from her good friends Orm that she constantly 
                            pokes with her curious trunk. She’s a bit jealous of Mongkol, our 9 months old baby, 
                            which is stealing all the attentions. You can see her disappointed when he gets fed 
                            the milk. She would love to have it as well!!She’s pretty easy to identify. Due to her 
                            young age she’s quite smaller than the other elephants and she still doesn’t have 
                            visible tusks. She doesn’t present any patch of depigmentation on the trunk, but she 
                            has two peculiar spots on her cheekbones. If you want her to love you give her 
                            bananas and sugarcanes, but don’t feed her sweet potatoes; even a small one and 
                            she will spit everything out!</p>
